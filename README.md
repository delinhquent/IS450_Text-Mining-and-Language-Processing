## Contributions to Project
I was primarily involved in the second task of our project where we would develop models to identify potentially weaker students that might require extra assistance by predicting their assignment grades from their feedback. We conducted feature engineering and explored with different models to establish our baseline models. Afterwards, we came up with 3 approaches to evaluate which approach best suit for our data. We also conducted gap analysis so that future works can be done to improve our solution.
